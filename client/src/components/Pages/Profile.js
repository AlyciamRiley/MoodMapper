    <p>
      I just started using this app last week. My hope is that it will help me become more aware of my ups and downs as I see my moods graphed over time. When I meet with my therapist, I usually find it hard to rememember how my week went and when exactly I was feeling good or bad, especially if I haven't seen her in over a week.
